# Address Book Application

## Technology Intro
This application runs on a flask server and was developed in python3. It utilizes a sqlite3 database to store user credentials as well as user content. Docker was utilized to containerize the application and then pushed to Docker Hub. Additionally, the Docker container is hosted on AWS Cloud Services - ElasticBeanstalk for public access. 

## Marketing & Sales
This application is best suited for the demographic that resists the upgrade to smart phones, but cannot keep track of that address book they have at home. It provides an accessible site to view any contacts you may have use for. It cannot be misplaced and it will not be destroyed. Although the market for the application is currently small and less clear, there is imense room for growth within the application to utilize more functionality and broaden its target audience. <br /><br />
Currently, it does not cost users to register and use an account within the application. 
However, this does not mean there is no margin for potential profits. As traffic and activity on the site increases, larger corporations will start to take notice. This could mean partnerships with tech giants such as Apple or Google. Tech corporations are always interested in ways to connect users and provide useful services. 

## Costs
As with sales, costs will increase as traffic and activity increases. With the application currently running on ElasticBeanstalk's free tier, this allows the costs to be nothing to maintain the site. However, when demand increases, the processing power required to run the application will also increase and eventually exceed the free tier limits. The free tier limit is 750 hours a month of free credit. After exceeding that 750 hours, the second cheapest pricing tier is $0.0255 per hour.
